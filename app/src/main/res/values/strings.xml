    <string name="wellness_health_content_monday">Drinking Tea after a meal can cause long term harm?\n\n5 more foods to avoid after food.\n\nTea/Coffee:\nAyurveda describes some common things that a person should NOT do after having lunch or dinner. Today, health science is backing it up with research and facts. Let\'s find out what are the things to avoid immediately after consuming a meal.\n\nBoth these beverages have benefits when consumed in a moderate amount. Drink them at least one hour after any meal.\n\n <b>Fruits:</b>\nIt takes around 20 minutes for any fruit (except bananas) to travel from your stomach and get digested in the intestines. Eating a fruit after a meal gets stuck with the food, thus not traveling in time to the intestines, and getting spoiled as a result, and spoiling the food too!\n\n<b>Don’t bathe</b>\nAccording to Ayurveda, bathing after a meal increases the flow of blood to the hands and legs. Thus the amount of blood around the stomach will decrease. This weakens the digestive system of the stomach.\n\n<b>Sleep:</b>\nThe food will not be digested properly, leading to gastric issues.\n\n<b>Don’t swim Or do physical exercise</b>\nIt’s best to wait for at least more than 30 minutes to do any exercise after eating food.
